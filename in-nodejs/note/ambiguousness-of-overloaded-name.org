  - type-constructor name can not be overloaded.
    it will serve as the root of our recursion
    to remove ambiguousness.

  - data-constructor is the same as function.

  - function name can be overloaded :

    1. different function can share the same name,
       if they have different types.

    2. given a function and its type,
       we can uniquely distinguish
       its corresponding function body.

    3. given only a function name,
       to remove the ambiguousness of overloaded name,
       we need to fill in the ommited information about its type.

       - x -
         but this is impossible in a our language,
         because, if the function names are overloaded,
         we can not even decide
         1. how many input data a function takes
         2. how many output data a function returns

       - k -
         this also means,
         there are more informations in the syntax
         of prefix notation with full parentheses.
