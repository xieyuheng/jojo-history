* type checker alone

  - an interpreter might only implements
    the type checker of a programming language.

  - it can execute functions in the language,
    but it can only do so in a non-optimized way.

    - for example, without proper tail call.

  - another interpreter will be implemented
    to execute functions in the language
    in a better way, which will ignore
    much of the informations about type.

  - to really optimize the execution,
    a compiler must be written,
    in which all the informations about type
    can be used to optimize the compilation.
