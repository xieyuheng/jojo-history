#+title: notes

* P 0

  - when I am trying to write a relatively complex program,
    I factored my functions well,
    and took notes about them.

  - but after a while, when I come back to them,
    I often found myself still unable to recall
    all the mental activities as they was.

  - how should I recall such mental activities successfully ?

* S 0

  - to take notes in form of problems and solutions,
    because programming is a problem solving activity.

  - thus if notes are taken in this form,
    the actions of mind will be recorded most faithfully.

* P 1

  - there was no problem at all, until chiso is revealed,
    then everything were reviewed
    with chiso in mind.

  - there was no problem for me, until I learned forth,
    function composition owns more symmetry than
    function application,
    a new language must be designed accordingly,
    with chiso in mind.
