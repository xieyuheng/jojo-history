* optimization

  - (+type) defines abstract datatype

    abstract-syntax is a special representation of data

    once defined, we have constructors and extractors
    we must be able to replace them with more efficient functions.
    [to optimize representation independent functions]

    - take <nat> as an example
      when representing number as list of numbers with a large base
      we must optimize 'add'
      to make use of the the representation of the data.

    - <env> is another example

    we must design a API for this feature
