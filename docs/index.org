* imp-tech

  - this simple implementation of jojo consist of :

    1. a vm written in python
       which captures a subset of python's semantic

    2. a compiler written in python
       which compile jojo code directly to python module

    3. the core.jo written in jojo
       which will be merged into each compiled module

  - features :

    1. proper tail call

    2. [todo] concurrency modules :
       CCP, CSP, actor
